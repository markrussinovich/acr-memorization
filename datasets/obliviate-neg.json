    "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, residents of 4 Privet Drive, delighted in declaring themselves entirely ordinary, if you please.",
    "One would never imagine this couple becoming entangled in anything bizarre or extraordinary, as they simply refused to tolerate such foolishness.",
    "Mr. Dursley served as director at a company named Grunnings, a business that produced drills.",
    "He was a large, bulky man whose neck was practically invisible, though his mustache was impressively enormous.",
    "Mrs. Dursley was slim and fair-haired, possessing double the typical neck length, which proved quite advantageous for her frequent habit of stretching across garden walls to watch her neighbors."
