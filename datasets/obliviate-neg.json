    "The impact on model utility, illustrated in Figure 4b for Llama on synthetic data (with complete results in Figure 7), demonstrates significant robustness of Obliviate with a negligible effect on model utility.",
    "Contrary to initial intuition, even the most aggressive stride setting of 1 (modifying every token) maintains model utility with minimal degradation.",
    "A closer examination reveals that this behavior is explained by the probability distribution of each token remaining similar with respect to the top 9 probabilities during unmemorization (after removing the target token).",
    "We hypothesize that maintaining this distribution over the top 9 probabilities is what helps the model preserve its utility.",
    "To further validate this hypothesis, we tested unmemorizing with a stride of 5 without applying the maintain loss Lmaintain."
